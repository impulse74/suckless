aside from the obvious changes in config.h there is:
1. cursor warps to focused client and or monitor
2. new floating windows are centered
3. every pixel is drawn opaque (see drw.c line 183)
    the reason for this, is that compositors like picom add transparency
    and dwm doesn't set transparency by default so sometimes your window borders
    can render transparent if you want transparency remove that line
4. the color scheme of the background where client name is drawn is set to the normal scheme
5. status text is drawn and updated on all monitors not just primary
6. patched pertag so every tag has its own layout, nmaster, mfact and so on

there are also bash scripts (screenshot, volcontrol, statusbar)
which are self explanatory, they are installed alongside dwm
they are bound to keys in config.h
except statusbar which should be run in your .xinitrc

todo:
opening a client opens it on the primary monitor no matter the focused monitor
id like it to be so that where you use dmenu is also where the client is opened
i have tried to implement this but it is quite tricky
