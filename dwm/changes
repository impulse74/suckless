aside from the obvious changes in config.h there is:
- new floating windows are centered
- every pixel is drawn opaque (see drw.c line 183)
    the reason for this, is that compositors like picom add transparency
    and dwm doesn't set transparency by default so sometimes your window borders
    can render transparent if you want transparency remove that line
- status text is drawn and updated on all monitors not just primary
- patched pertag so every tag has its own layout, nmaster, mfact and so on
- patched preserveonrestart so that restarting doesn't put every client on tag 1

there are also bash scripts (screenshot.sh, volcontrol.sh, statusbar.sh)
which are self explanatory, they are installed alongside dwm
they are bound to keys in config.h
except statusbar.sh which should be run in your .xinitrc
